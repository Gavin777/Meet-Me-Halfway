# Meet-Me-Halfway

This is an interactive webpage that provides a map and directions (by car, walking, biking or public transport) for two people looking to meet halfway.

Takes a destination and search query (i.e. dinner) as inputs. Automatically retrieves userâ€™s current location and provides directions to the halfway point or the location(s) of interest selected from the search query.

Note: I ran into an issue with Geolocation in Google Chrome as Chrome does not allow your location to be found if you simply open up the html file. I solved this issue by starting up a Python server (with Python 2.7.6). I ran "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" in the correct directory and got to view my webpage at "http://localhost:8000/Maps.html".
